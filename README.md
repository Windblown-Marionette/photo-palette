# photo-palette



This project takes an image and returns its most prevalent colors.

It provides a simple exploration into image data in opencv-python and uses scikit-learn and matplotlib to summarize color data via clustering and show it.

## files included:

#### working-demo.ipynb

This is a quick demo of the software, intended for use with jupyter notebooks. It uses sample images found in the data folder.

#### project-notebook.ipynb

This functions similarly to a lab notebook and details the production process.
